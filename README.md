## MCP Servers on MacOS/Linux/Windows

MCP servers let AI models safely connect to stuff outside themselves—like your files, notes, or code—without giving them full access to your whole computer. Think of them as little bridges that let the AI peek in and help out where you want.

***

## Some cool things you can do with MCP servers:

- Read and edit files on your computer

- Work with Git repos and manage your code

- Access notes from apps like Obsidian

- Run simple scripts or commands safely
